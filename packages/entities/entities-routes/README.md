- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Included components](#included-components)
- [Usage](#usage)
  - [Install](#install)
  - [Registration](#registration)
- [Individual component documentation](#individual-component-documentation)

## Requirements

- `vue` and `vue-router` must be initialized in the host application
- `@kong/kongponents` must be added as a dependency in the host application, globally available via the Vue Plugin installation, and the package's style imports must be added in the app entry file. [See here for instructions on installing Kongponents](https://kongponents.konghq.com/#globally-install-all-kongponents).
- `@kong-ui-public/i18n` must be available as a `dependency` in the host application.
- `axios` must be installed as a dependency in the host application
- `@kong-ui-public/expressions` and `monaco-editor` must be installed as **`devDependencies`**. If you don't need to support [Kong's Expressions language](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/expressions-language/)-related features, you will need to add the following configuration to your Vite config to avoid them to be bundled with your build result:

```ts
defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      external: ['@kong-ui-public/expressions', 'monaco-editor'],
    },
  },
})
```

## Included components

- `RouteList`
- `RouteForm`
- `RouteConfigCard`

Reference the [individual component docs](#individual-component-documentation) for more info.
